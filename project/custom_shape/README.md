# Hourglass

This directory contains code for my abstract shape representation of an
hourglass that can be found in hourglass.c

Additionally, the Makefile located in this directory has the capability to
make the object files for each source file. Simply type 'make' to build the
library and 'make clean' to remove all .o files.
