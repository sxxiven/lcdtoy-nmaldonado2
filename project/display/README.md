# Display

This directory contains files for the three main shape moving displays:
catch_red_display, fur_elise_display, and find_frequency_display. It also
contains move_layer.c and move_layer.h which are used to make the shapes
move. display_utils implements a function to fill a rectangle of pixels.

Additionally, the Makefile located in this directory has the capability to
make the object files for each source file. Simply type 'make' to build the
library and 'make clean' to remove all .o files.
